# ðŸ§® Problem 1: Linear Regression â€“ Estimate Variance of y
##############################################################

# Problem Statement:
# The data below represent investment (in $1000) in the development of new software 
# by a computer company over an 11-year period.
# 
# Year (x): 2000â€“2010
# Investment (y): 17, 23, 31, 29, 33, 39, 39, 40, 41, 44, 47
#
# Fit a linear regression model with y as the dependent variable and 
# estimate the variance of y.

# --- Solution Code ---
year <- c(2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)
investment <- c(17, 23, 31, 29, 33, 39, 39, 40, 41, 44, 47)

# Fit Linear Regression Model
model <- lm(investment ~ year)

# Extract coefficients

# Estimate Variance of y (ÏƒÂ² = RSS / (n - 2))
residuals <- resid(model)

# ðŸ§ª Problem 2: One-Sample z-Test for Mean (Two-Tailed)
##############################################################

# Problem Statement:
# The melting point of each of 16 samples of a certain brand of hydrogenated vegetable oil 
# was determined. The sample mean is xÌ„ = 94.32, population standard deviation Ïƒ = 1.20.
# Assume normal distribution.
# 
# Hypotheses:
#   H0: Î¼ = 95
#   H1: Î¼ â‰  95
# 
# Perform a two-tailed z-test at Î± = 0.05.

# --- Solution Code ---
x_bar <- 94.32
mu_0 <- 95
sigma <- 1.20
n <- 16
alpha <- 0.05

# Compute Z statistic
z_value <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (sigma / sqrt(n))
z_value

# Compute p-value (two-tailed)
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_value)))
p_value

# Decision
if (p_value < alpha) {
  cat("Reject H0: Significant evidence that mu â‰  95\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to Reject H0: No significant difference from 95\n")
}

# Critical Z and Summary
z_critical <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
cat("Z critical values are Â±", round(z_critical, 3), "\n")

# ðŸ“Š Problem 3: Normal Distribution â€“ IQ Score Probabilities
##############################################################

# Problem Statement:
# IQ scores are normally distributed with:
#   Mean (Î¼) = 100
#   Standard deviation (Ïƒ) = 15
#
# Find:
#   1. P(X < 110) â†’ Probability that IQ is less than 110
#   2. P(X > 125) â†’ Probability that IQ is greater than 125
#   3. The IQ score corresponding to the 90th percentile.

# --- Solution Code ---
mean_iq <- 100
sd_iq <- 15

# 1. Probability that IQ < 110
p_less_110 <- pnorm(110, mean = mean_iq, sd = sd_iq)
cat("P(IQ < 110) =", round(p_less_110, 4), "\n")

# 2. Probability that IQ > 125
p_greater_125 <- 1 - pnorm(125, mean = mean_iq, sd = sd_iq)
cat("P(IQ > 125) =", round(p_greater_125, 4), "\n")

# 3. IQ score representing 90th percentile
iq_90th <- qnorm(0.90, mean = mean_iq, sd = sd_iq)
cat("IQ score for 90th percentile =", round(iq_90th, 2), "\n")
